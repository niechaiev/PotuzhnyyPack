[Rendering]

## The currently orbited planet is visible on the ship's external security camera while in space, as it used to be in v38.
## You should disable this if you encounter lighting issues on the ship.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
PlanetPreview = true

## Light passes and spreads through the foliage for nicer visuals. Performance impact is negligible.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true

# Setting type: FogQuality
# Default value: Default
# Acceptable values: Default, Medium, High

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false

## "Fixes" Artifice's global volume, which has the exact opposite issue of Titan. This is more of a subjective change, but makes Artifice look more vibrant.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
FixArtificeVolume = false
